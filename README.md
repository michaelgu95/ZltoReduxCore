# ZltoReduxCore
Redux architectural core for zlto.me

## Features
* [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)
* [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
* [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* [karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma)
* [eslint](http://eslint.org)

## Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```
If everything works, you should see the following:

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon for the server as well.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`deploy:dev`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`deploy:prod`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).|

## Application Structure

The application structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type.

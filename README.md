# ZltoReduxCore
Redux architectural core for Zlto Mobile Wallet App (zlto.co)

## Features
* [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)
* [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
* [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* [karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma)
* [eslint](http://eslint.org)

## Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

## Steps for Development

When developing a new feature or page, you should follow these general steps:

1.  Creating a new Route folder for the page
2.  Register the route under `src/routes/index.js`, passing in the store under `ChildRoutes`
3.  Create your action constants, action creators, and reducers within the modules folder of your route 
4.  Under `/containers`, create your Higher Level Component (HOC) that will provide props and actions to your view
5.  Under `/components`, create your Page Level Component, which can either be standalone or composed of smaller, dumb components
6.  Create an index.js file for your route folder. This allows webpack to correctly grab your container and reducer when your route is hit. This follows the Fractal folder structure, which is a lower level optimization of webpack that only requires your route's files when the route is hit. 

## Development Best Practices
*  `src/store` is where the store, reducer, hot module reload are configured
*  `main.js` is where everything comes together and finally rendered to the DOM
*  `components` and `containers` is intended for reusable modules shared across routes
*  All async actions should be defined in your `src/{your route}/modules/` folder. 
*  Use react-router's push function to direct users after an AJAX call finishes.

## Scripts
While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon for the server as well.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`deploy:dev`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`deploy:prod`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).|

## Application Structure

The application structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type.
